                      Fred the Baker Baking Company has a rich history that dates
                      back to the first bakeries on Drury Lane. The company was
                      founded by Fred Baker Man, the brother of the famous Muffin
                      Man. After a heated disagreement with his brother over whether
                      their muffin shop should expand to offer more variety, Fred
                      decided to strike out on his own and start his own bakery.

                    <p>
                      Fred was determined to offer a wider range of baked goods and
                      believed that there was more to baking than just muffins. He
                      dropped his last name and became known as Fred the Baker. His
                      new donut shop on Drury Lane quickly became a sensation,
                      attracting customers from far and wide who were eager to try
                      this new delicacy.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                      As the donut shop grew in popularity, it paved the way for
                      other baked goods to be introduced and enjoyed by the masses.
                      However, despite their success, Fred and his brother never
                      fully reconciled their differences.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                      After their passing, their children took over the family
                      businesses and eventually merged them into one company: Fred
                      the Baker Baking Company. Today, this unrivaled baking company
                      brings joy to billions of people around the world by
                      leveraging the power of the internet to share their delicious
                      baked goods.
